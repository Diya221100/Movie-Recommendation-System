# Gold Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict gold prices using machine learning techniques. The predictive models utilized include Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest, and Decision Tree.

## Models
1. **Support Vector Regression (SVR):**
   - Utilizes the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel to capture non-linear relationships.

2. **Random Forest:**
   - An ensemble of decision trees to handle complex patterns and feature interactions.

3. **Decision Tree:**
   - A single decision tree for capturing patterns and relationships within the dataset.

## Getting Started
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Diya221100/gold-price-prediction.git
   cd gold-price-prediction
   ```

## Results
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- Visualize predictions against actual gold prices.
- Interpret feature importance for insights into the factors influencing predictions.
